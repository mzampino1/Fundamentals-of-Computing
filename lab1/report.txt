My program is a distance calculator that uses the two-dimensional distance formula
to calculate the distance between two points,
where point 1 is represented by (x1, y1) and point 2 is represented by (x2, y2).
The user is welcomed to the program, then prompted to enter the x1, y1, x2, and y2 values, 
which can be positive or negative integers and decimals. 
The program outputs the distance between the two points.

The program declares the variables as doubles, then prints an introduction for the user.
It then prompts the user to enter the values, assigning these values to their respective variables.
Finally, the program computes the distance using the square root and power functions, then prints the value.

I tested the program by entering integer values, decimal values, and negative values.
I then manually calculated the distance using the formula and compared this to the result of the program.
The program produces correct results in all cases, as long as the user inputs values correctly.
